Development informations
========================

Developments are based on 2 documents: 

* RFXtrx SDK.pdf: the SDF for the usb model. It describes all handled hardware and how to use them with the rfxcom device. This file can be ask to RFXCOM support.
* RFXCOM implementation xPL.pdf: the specification of the used xPL messages for the lan model. To be compliant, we used these messages also for the usb model. This file is available on the official website.
